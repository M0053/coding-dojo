Coding Dojo
===========

This repo is for hosting the coding katas for our Coding Dojo.  If you'd like to participate, go ahead and fork it and work on it.  You don’t have to put your solution here of course, but this repo is here if you’d like a convenient place to keep your katas and view others’ solutions. 

I'm attempting to revive this repo by reorganizing it so that each kata has its own directory. If you wouldn't mind, please create a subdirectory in the directory for the kata you’re solving  (use your shortname, GitHub username, childhood nickname, whatever you prefer). So for example, my solution to the poker hand evaluation kata would be in poker_kata/hatkinson.
